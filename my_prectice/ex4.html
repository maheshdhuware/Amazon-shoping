How  HTML  works  step  by  step?
	How does HTML work? Quite simply, HTML works by telling the internet browser 
how to display the page. First, the author uses a basic text editor on the computer 
(such as TextEdit for Mac) to create their HTML document. The author then fills their 
HTML document with a series of HTML elements, using HTML tags.
